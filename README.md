# Gravekeeper

Gravekeeper is a game created during the GI Jam, held over three days, January 23 - January 25, 2015, hosted by the [University of Waterlooâ€™s Games Institute](https://uwaterloo.ca/games-institute/).  Gravekeeper is a game that requires two players connected on the same network to play.

One player depicts the titular gravekeeper, who is trying to survive the night while under assault from a demonic monster, which is played by the second player.  The gravekeeper has two choices: survive a harrowing night while escaping detection from the demonic monster, or kill the demonic monster by setting traps and hoping that the demonic monster triggers them.

Gravekeeper was built using the [Unity game engine](http://unity3d.com/), and uses the [2DVLS library](http://u3d.as/content/pico-games/2dvls/36x).
